## Project Overview

**Black Hat for Good** simulates the full lifecycle of an ethical hacking engagement. Over five days, you’ll practice real-world offensive techniques—reconnaissance, mapping, exploitation, pivoting, and reporting—while maintaining strict OPSEC. Perfect for aspiring pentesters, red teamers, and security pros building a standout portfolio.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Kali Linux** (or another Debian-based distro)  
- **Python 3** (>= 3.6)  
- **Bash shell**  
- **Tor & Proxychains**  
- **Nmap, WhatWeb, Nikto**  
- **Metasploit Framework**  
- **Responder & PowerSploit**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jxnesyy/black-hat-for-good-github.git
    cd black-hat-for-good-github
    ```
2. **(Optional) Python venv**  
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

Each day lives in its own folder. Always route through Tor or your VPN before running tools to keep your activities private.

```bash

# Example: Run Day 3

cd day3-phantom-injector
bash cloak.sh             # Sets up Tor/Proxychains
python3 phantom_injector.py target.local

Use the provided Markdown templates to log findings and craft professional reports.

Daily Challenges
Day 1: Recon Ghost
Focus: Passive recon, GitHub dorking, OPSEC

Goal: Discover exposed assets and footprints without touching targets directly.

Day 2: Hunter Grid
Focus: Attack surface mapping, automation, batch scanning

Goal: Automate Nmap/WhatWeb/Nikto scans and compile results into a structured report.

Day 3: Phantom Injector
Focus: Safe exploitation, payload staging, meterpreter basics

Goal: Identify a low-risk exploit, deliver a staged payload via Metasploit, and capture an initial foothold.

Day 4: Lateral Sweep
Focus: Pivoting, credential harvesting, AD enumeration

Goal: Use responder and PowerSploit to harvest credentials, perform SMB relay attacks, and map the internal network.

Day 5: Black Lotus Operation
Focus: Persistence, cleanup, executive reporting

Goal: Deploy a stealthy persistence mechanism, erase traces, and deliver a polished executive summary and technical debrief.
