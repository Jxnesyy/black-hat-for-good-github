## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to **Black Hat for Good**—a 5-day, hands-on cybersecurity challenge that takes you inside the mind of a top-level offensive hacker, but with an ethical mission.

This project is designed for:
- Aspiring pentesters and red teamers
- Security engineers who want to understand the attacker’s mindset
- Self-taught hackers seeking a real-world portfolio
- Anyone who wants to **learn, document, and ethically “hack for good”**

Each day simulates a real engagement phase, combining advanced tools, stealth (OPSEC), and pro-level reporting—so you’ll leave with skills that impress both companies and elite hackers.

## 🚦 How to Use This Project

- **Each day is a standalone folder:**  
  Start at Day 1 and progress, following the scripts and Markdown reports provided.

- **OPSEC is mandatory:**  
  Always cloak up with VPN or Tor (`ghost` command) before running any scans or scripts.

- **All targets are demo/allowed targets** (e.g., `example.com`) **for educational purposes.**  
  Never attack unauthorized systems.

- **Document your findings:**  
  Use the provided Markdown templates for each day to keep a professional record of your process and results.
