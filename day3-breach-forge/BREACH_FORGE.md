### 2. Brute-Force Simulation (Optional/If Used)

Hydra ran a brute-force attack on the local FTP server (192.168.56.101).
Hydra was unable to brute-force the FTP server using the top 14 million passwords from rockyou.txt.
All attempts were denied. The server may be well-configured or test credentials may not be present.
